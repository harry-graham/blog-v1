# 📔 My first post: Setting up the blog

I set up this blog using the instructions in [this article](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html).

Massive thanks to [Chad Baldwin](https://github.com/chadbaldwin) for this, his instructions and template repo made the process so simple and straight-forward, and much less daunting.

Those resources enabled me to initialise the blog site in less than 5 minutes, which allowed me to instead spend my time exploring some of the config and writing this post.

## 🛠️ Step 1 - Initialising the blog

The process was incredibly straight-forward: I simply had to generate the blog repo via [this link](https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap/generate), which I had to name `<my-username>.github.io` in order to be recognised as a "GitHub Pages" repo.

That was it!

At this stage, GitHub had immediately started hosting the blog site, with all of the placeholder details from the repo, and it had taken less than 5 minutes to do.

## 📃 Step 2 - Updating some placeholder details

Next, I was ready to start replacing any placeholder details with my own. This included:

- Adding a very basic README file
- Updating my email and social media handles
- Updating the blog site title
- Updating the blog site description
- Updating the blog site index/intro text
- Writing the first blog post (this one! 😄)

## Conclusion

I now have a blog! 🥳🎉

## 🌄 Next steps

Some of the things I'm planning to do next are:

- Learn how to run the blog locally, to be able to manually test things before committing them

Some other ideas I may potentially consider in future:

- Adding some automated testing
- Running the tests in CI (via GitHub Actions)
