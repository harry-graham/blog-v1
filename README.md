This was my first attempt at creating a blog/profile.

I followed [this article](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) to
initialise the repository and to set up the initial details, but quickly found that many things
that I wanted to tweak were not very obvious from the code.

Upon further investigation, I also found that lots of things had been stripped out of the linked
article's template repo, in order to try to make it easier for non-technical users to set up their
own blogs.

Whilst it did indeed achieve that goal, it meant that lots of details and learning about
setting up a GitHub pages blog using Jekyll were hidden from me.

Given my passion for learning and for creating high-quality products, I couldn't resist reattempting
this myself using the official instructions for this: [Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

This also very quickly and easily showed me how to test the GitHub pages locally, which was something
I really wanted/needed to know.

I'm very excited to see what I'm able to come up with, and am grateful for the initial-linked article
for helping to get me started down the path of having a GitHub Pages blog using Jekyll.
